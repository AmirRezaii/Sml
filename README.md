# Sml : Simple Machine Learning
this is a project for me to learn simple machine learning from the basics.
## Building
for the first time building run the command below
``` sh
cc -o nob ./nob.c
```
now use the nob builder tool to compile and build the binary.
``` sh
./nob
```
a directory called build will be created and the binary is located there.

to compile and run the app at the same time use the command below.
``` sh
./nob run
```
